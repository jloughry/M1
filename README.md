System Architecture
-------------------

M1 is a 16-bit computer designed by me in 1991 after I decided I lacked a deep enough
understanding of computer architecture.  It was designed along RISC principles; the
instruction set consists of eight instructions.

I was inspired to do this by the Operating Systems theory classes taught by Professor
Gary Nutt at the University of Colorado in Boulder.  A couple of years after leaving
school, I brought the computer to his office to demonstrate it and explained that the
entire project had been done because of an exchange that happened in class one day:

> Prof. Nutt: Do you know what the control unit is?
> 
> Student: Sure...it's a box with magic in it.

I thought that level of understanding was unsatisfactory, so I did this.
